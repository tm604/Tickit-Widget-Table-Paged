	New features:
	* Row visibility - allows filtering rows to show a subset of data,
	see the ->filter method for more details
	* Row update and delete

	Bugs fixed:
	* Avoid warnings when no alignment is specified (default is 'left')
	* Fix numeric alignment (can now use 0.5, 1.0 etc. as originally
	intended, previously it had to be 'centre', 'right' etc.)
	* Scrollbar rendering - sometimes this extended into header due
	to incorrect ratio calculation
