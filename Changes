Revision history for {{$dist->name}}

{{$NEXT}}
	New features:
	* Adapter support - underlying data is provided by an
	Adapter::Async::OrderedList instance, allowing the table widget to
	receive updates when the underlying data source changes
	* Row visibility - allows filtering rows to show a subset of data,
	see the ->filter method for more details
	* Transformations - used for applying specific formatting or text
	conversion, such as timestamp => date and time representation or
	word highlighting

	Bugs fixed:
	* Avoid warnings when no alignment is specified (default is 'left')
	* Fix numeric alignment (can now use 0.5, 1.0 etc. as originally
	intended, previously it had to be 'centre', 'right' etc.)
	* Scrollbar rendering - sometimes this extended into header due
	to incorrect ratio calculation

	Bugs introduced:
	* Filtering does not yet work reliably. It might not work at all.
	You should probably wait for the next version.
